# To-do with React, TypeScript, SASS and Vitest using Vite

## Initial setup

To create the project with Vite run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Selected:

- **Project name:** todo-react-ts-vitest
- **Framework:** React
- **Variant:** TypeScript

After Vite created the project we moved to the project, installed the dependencies and run the project in dev mode to test that it worked properly:

```bash
cd todo-react-ts-vitest
npm install
npm run dev
```

After the quick check, we proceeded cleaning the project of unnecessary assets and code.
